Make your WhatsApp live again.

There's a wonderful tweak called [blockWAUpdates](https://github.com/0xkuj/blockWAUpdates/tree/master) that lets you close that annoying banner that tells you to go visit AppStore to update your WhatsApp version. You install it, and you're happy, because you think you just tricked Zuck with his forced updates. Not quite! Apparently, WhatsApp server also wants to force you to upgrade and literally closes the connection with your app. This tweak tells WhatsApp server that today is not the day.

Tested with WhatsApp version from late December. Potentially, it should work with an even earlier releases, too

Enjoy!
